Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessel. In 2012 it kills 17 million people, makes 31\% of all death in the world\footnote{WHO, Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), retrieved from http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs317/en/ on Feb 2, 2015 }. 
According to some researches, heart rate (HR) is an independent predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in men and women with and without diagnosed cardiovascular disease1. Heart rate was assigned the same weighting as blood pressure and cardiorespiratory fitness in the overall score1. On the other hand, It's vital to monitor your heart rate during exercise3. A target heart rate is recommended to reach best exercise goal. Time is important when heart attack suddenly occur, time is life, handling emergency situation is a problem when patient is not near there relatives.
